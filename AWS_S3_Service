- Amazon Simple Storage Service (s3) has unlimited storage service but individual service cannot be more than 5TB in size.
- Has 99.999999999% durability and up to 99.99% availability
* S3 are classified how they are loaded and accessed from and into S3:
    - S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Auto cost savings by auto-tiering with any access pattern.
    - S3 Standard: General purpose storage for active, for data which are frequently accessed.
                   This doesn’t have per GB retrieval cost. Here we pay more to store object but pay less to retrieve data.
    - S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA): Low-cost storage for data accessed monthly and requires milliseconds retrieval.
    - S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval: Low-cost storage for long lived data, with retrieval in milliseconds.
    - S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval: Long-term, low-cost storage for backups and archives with retrieval options from minutes to hours.
    - S3 Glacier Deep Archive: Lowest cost cloud storage for long term, rarely accessed archive data, with retrieval in hours.
    - S3 1 Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 1 Zone-IA): Infrequently accessed data in a single AZ for cost savings.
    - S3 on Outposts: Delivers object storage to on-premises AWS outposts environments to meet local data processing and data residency needs. Encrypted with SSE-S3
 * Infrequent access S3 services have more retrieval cost and lower storage cost.

-	S3 Security: 
    -	Data stored in S3 is secure by default.
    -	Access control with IAM and bucket policies.
    -	S3 Access points
    -	S3 Block Public Access: Restrict to specific VPC with firewall
    -	IAM Access Analyzer: helps to identify what data are shared externally
    -	Encrypt data by default in S3
    
•	EXAM: S3 Transfer Acceleration helps reduce network variability by physically shortening the distance between apps and AWS.
        Any question speaking about long distance uploads, or finding ways to increase data transfer with S3, consider S3TA.
